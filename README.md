# Daily Diary

A diary web app for recording diary entries daily.

## Description and Approach

This is an online 'Daily Diary' web application, built in Ruby.  I've used Sinatra for a browser based user interface and PostgreSQL to store diary entries in a database.
This app is built with BDD using Capybara.

This project helps me reflect on learning from Makers Academy week 4 course content, using TDD and, OOD principles.
